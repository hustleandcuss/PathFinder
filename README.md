# PathFinder

This is an school assignment done for a Java course.

Path Finder is an Java application that lets you (by clicking "File" -> "New") choose a map and then add places on the map as well as add and edit different connection between the locations. The application can then calculate the route between two places (event though these are not directly connected).

This application was coded in Sublime and tested and run as well as packaged from the terminal. 

Made in late 2014/early 2015.
